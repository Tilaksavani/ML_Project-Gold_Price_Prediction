# ML_Project-Gold_Price_Prediction

This project delves into the fascinating realm of gold price prediction using a Random Forest regression model. It leverages the power of Random Forest to uncover patterns in historical gold price data and associated influencing factors, aiming to forecast future gold prices.

### Data
  This directory stores the gold price data in CSV format. It's assumed the dataset contains attributes like:
  
  - Date
  - SPX
  - GLD
  - USO
  - SLV
  - EUR/USD
    
**notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`gold_price_prediction.ipynb`) for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.



**Model and Evaluation**

- The included Jupyter Notebook (`gold_price_prediction.ipynb`) guides you through the following steps:
    1. Data loading and exploration (understanding data distribution, identifying missing values, etc.)
    2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, potentially dealing with time-series aspects)
    3. Feature engineering (optional, creating new features from existing ones)
    4. Model training with Random Forest regression
    5. Model evaluation (metrics like mean squared error, R-squared)
    6. Visualization of results (exploring feature importance, predicted vs. actual gold prices)

**Customization**

- You can modify the Jupyter Notebook to:
    - Experiment with different hyperparameters for the Random Forest model (number of trees, maximum depth, etc.)
    - Try other regression algorithms like Support Vector Regression (SVR) or Gradient Boosting for comparison.
    - Explore advanced feature engineering techniques like time series analysis (e.g., moving averages, seasonality) to capture temporal patterns in gold prices.

**Further Contributions**

- Feel free to extend this project by:
    - Including additional relevant factors (e.g., global events, currency fluctuations) that might influence gold prices.
    - Implementing techniques for handling non-stationarity in time series data.
    - Using the model to forecast gold prices for future time horizons.
    - Integrating the model into a web application for real-time gold price prediction.

By leveraging Random Forest regression, we can gain insights into historical trends and potentially make informed predictions about future gold prices. This project lays the foundation for further exploration in this dynamic domain.
